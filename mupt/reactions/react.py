    Run the reaction workflow named by a MuPT reactions config.

    The config is common to every reaction engine; `reaction_engine['name']` selects which one runs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    inputs : dict or str or Path
        The reactions config as a dict, or a path to the YAML file holding it.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        The config dict, enriched in place by the engine's workflow.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the config is malformed, names no engine, or names an unrecognized one.
    NotImplementedError
        If the config selects a known engine that MuPT does not yet drive.

# Keys every reactions config carries, whichever engine runs it. The per-reaction keys are the reaction

    Reports every problem at once rather than the first, and runs before dispatch so a malformed config

    checked by the engine itself.

    Parameters
    ----------
    inputs : dict
        The reactions config.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If any required key is missing or malformed, listing all of them.
